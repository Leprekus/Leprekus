## About Me 
I am a self taught full-stack developer with three years of professional experience. I am currently pursuing a bachelor's degree in Computer Science at the University of Victoria. My hobbies include building new ideas that I come up with. I also enjoy exercising and reading. I am a fairly outgoing person and enjoy taking the initiative and will not relent until I achieve the desired outcome.
